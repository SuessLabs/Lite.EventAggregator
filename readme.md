# Lite Event Aggregator in C#

The Event Aggregator service in C# pattern is useful for decoupling publishers and subscribers in an application.

# Features

This implementation is simple and thread-safe. 

In the next release, we'll include:

* **Weak references** to avoid memory leaks.
* **Async** support for event handling.
* Possibly, filtering or priority-based dispatching.
